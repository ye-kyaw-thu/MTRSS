# MTRSS
MTRSS: Machine Translation Research Summer School

Here, I uploaded some files that I used at MTRSS (8-10 Oct, 2019),  
Yangon Technological University (YTU), Yangon, Myanmar.  

## Phrase-based Machine Translation

From the "pbsmt/" folder you can get the small Myanmar-Rakhine corpus and necessary script files for running PBSMT experiment.
"example-log-files/" is keeping some example error logs for your reference.

## Neural Machine Translation

Plan to add some files ...
