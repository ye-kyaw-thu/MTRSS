# MTRSS
MTRSS: Machine Translation Research Summer School

Here, I uploaded some files that I used at MTRSS (8-10 Oct, 2019),  
Yangon Technological University (YTU), Yangon, Myanmar.  

## Phrase-based Machine Translation (PBSMT)

From the "pbsmt/" folder you can get the small Myanmar-Rakhine corpus and necessary script files for running PBSMT experiment.  
"example-log-files/" is keeping some example error logs for your reference.  

## Neural Machine Translation (NMT)

See WAT2021/ repository, two teams (YCC-MT2 and NECTEC) prepared Neural Machine Translation systems for English-to-Myanmar and Myanmar-to-English machine translation share tasks of the 8th Workshop on Asian Translation workshop (WAT2021), Thailand. It might be a good starting point for your practical running of NMT.
